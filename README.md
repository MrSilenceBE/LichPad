# Description
The LichPad is a simple macropad with 9 keys, an OLED and an encoder so it can be used for multiple things.
Right now the script is very basic and I'm not sure if it will work but once i have it I will try to put more time in fixing it. I made the firmware with the help of a friend who has some experience with coding. For now it just acts as a numpad since the design reminds me of that but it will change. 
I made this to learn more about electronic projects such as PCB's and also to force myself to overcome certain challenges, and learn how to work with Fusion and KiCad. I will also force myself to learn how to program my project as soon as i get it and experiment with its capabilities. It has been very painful, but I learned a lot.
